# ML-based-Chatbot-Naive-Bayes-NLP-
This project is a machine learning-powered chatbot that uses Bag-of-Words (BoW) and a Naive Bayes classifier to understand user queries and respond appropriately.
If the model is not confident enough, the bot automatically opens a Google search for the query.

# ✨ Features
🧠 NLP with spaCy → Processes and normalizes user queries.
📊 Bag of Words (CountVectorizer) → Converts text into numerical features.
🤖 Naive Bayes Classifier → Predicts intent (greeting, name, feeling, hobby, goodbye, etc.).
🎯 Confidence Check → Responds only when prediction probability is high enough.
🌍 Google Fallback → Opens a Google search if the chatbot doesn’t understand.
💬 Interactive Chat Loop → Keeps chatting until user types "quit".
